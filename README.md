Genomic Analysis and Comparative Genomics of E. coli and Campylobacter coli
Project Purpose: Quantify and compare fundamental genomic features—gene count, composition, and selection pressures—between a versatile generalist bacterium (E. coli) and a specialized pathogen (C. coli).

This repository contains the R Markdown file and supporting data used to perform a comparative bioinformatics analysis, focusing on gene length distribution, nucleotide composition, and codon usage bias.
